An agent can do more than just respond to a prompt — it can **take actions** to find information or get things done.\n\nIn this notebook, you'll:\n\n- ✅ Install [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n- ✅ Configure your API key to use the Gemini model\n- ✅ Build your first simple agent\n- ✅ Run your agent and watch it use a tool (like Google Search) to answer a question\n\n**ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n\nThis notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only.

You can learn more about using Kaggle Notebooks [in the documentation](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/notebooks).\n\nHere's how to get started:\n\n**1. Verify Your Account (Required)**\n\nTo use the Kaggle Notebooks in this course, you'll need to verify your account with a phone number.\n\nYou can do this in your [Kaggle settings](https://www.kaggle.com/settings).\n\n**2. Make Your Own Copy**\n\nTo run any code in this notebook, you first need your own editable copy.\n\nClick the `Copy and Edit` button in the top-right corner.\n\n![Copy and Edit button](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/Images/5gdai_sc_1.png)\n\nThis creates a private copy of the notebook just for you.\n\n**3. Run Code Cells**\n\nOnce you have your copy, you can run code.\n\nClick the ▶️ Run button next to any code cell to execute it.\n\n![Run cell button](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/Images/5gdai_sc_2.png)\n\nRun the cells in order from top to bottom.\n\n**4. If You Get Stuck**\n\nTo restart: Select `Factory reset` from the `Run` menu.\n\nFor help: Ask questions on the [Kaggle Discord](https://discord.com/invite/kaggle) server.\n\n🚨 **NOTE:**  When you first start the notebook via running a cell you might see a banner in the notebook header that reads **\"Waiting for the next available notebook\"**. The queue should drop rapidly; however, during peak bursts you might have to wait a few minutes.\n\n🚨 **NOTE:** Avoid using the **Run all** cells command as this can trigger a QPM limit resulting in 429 errors when calling the backing model. Suggested flow is to run each cell in order - one at a time.
